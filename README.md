## 🚀 Getting Started
### 📦 Installation
There are three ways to get started with TraceView:

#### 🏗️ **Option 1: Build from Source**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/javaLux/traceview
   cd traceview
   ```
2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   cd target/release
   ./traceview
   ```

#### 📥 **Option 2: Download Pre-Compiled Binaries** *(Recommended for quick setup)*
If you don't want to build the project yourself or don't want to install Rust, you can download pre-compiled binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/javaLux/traceview/releases) section on GitHub:

##### 🔑 **How to Run the Downloaded Binary:**
1. Download the appropriate file for your operating system.
2. Extract the archive if necessary.
3. Make the binary executable (Linux/macOS):
   ```bash
   chmod +x traceview
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./traceview
   ```

#### 📦 **Option 3: Install via crates.io** *(Quick and direct installation)*
TraceView is available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/traceview), allowing users to install and run it directly without cloning the repository.

1. **Install using Cargo:**
   ```bash
   cargo install traceview
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   traceview
   ```

✅ **Advantages of this method:**
- The installed binary is placed in Cargo's bin directory (usually `~/.cargo/bin`), which is typically included in the system's `$PATH` environment variable.
- You can run `traceview` directly from any terminal without specifying the path.
- Easily update to the latest version with:
   ```bash
   cargo install traceview --force
   ```

## 🎨 Configuration
TraceView is configurable via the `config.toml` file located in the Config-Directory. Below is the structure of the default configuration file:

```toml
theme = "Dark"
start_dir = "<User Home Dir>"
export_dir = "<Application Data Directory>"
follow_sym_links = false
```
* You can see the applied configurations at any time in the app by pressing `F2`.

### ⚙️ **Configuration Options**
- **theme**: Describes the default theme on startup. Accepted values: "Dark", "Light", "Dracula", "Indigo".
  - **Default:** "Dark"
- **start_dir**: Describes the directory in which the file explorer should start. Leave empty to start in the current working directory.
  - **Default:** User's home directory
- **export_dir**: Describes the destination directory where the JSON export results will be saved.
  - **Default:** Application data directory
- **follow_sym_links**: Influences the file explorer, file/directory name search, and the recording of metadata for directories.
  - **What are symbolic links?** Symbolic links (or symlinks) are pointers to other files or directories. When this option is set to `true`, TraceView follows these links during navigation and searches, potentially traversing linked paths. When set to `false`, symlinks are ignored to avoid accidental infinite loops or unintended directory traversals.
  - **Default:** false

### ⚠️ **Invalid Configuration Handling**
If any settings in `config.toml` are incorrect or cannot be interpreted:
- The application will log a warning in the **log file** located in the app's `data` directory.
- Default settings will be applied automatically to ensure stability.
- Users should consult the log file for details on which settings failed to load and why.

### 🖥️ **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Options**
In addition to the `config.toml` file, TraceView supports command-line options for quick configuration overrides:

| Option | Description | Default | Constraints |
|--------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `-r`, `--refresh-rate <INTEGER>` | Refresh rate (ticks per second for system usage updates) | 1 | Maximum: 5 |
| `-f`, `--frame-rate <INTEGER>`   | Frame rate (frames rendered per second)                | 45 | Maximum: 60 |
| `-c`, `--config <FILE>`          | Use a specific configuration file                      | `<The default config file located in the Config-Dir>` | - |

✅ **Advantages of CLI options:**
- Override configuration settings without editing the default config file.
- Useful for temporary adjustments (e.g., increasing refresh rate during a session).
- Quick testing with different configurations.

Example usage:
```bash
traceview -r 2 -f 30 -c "/path/to/custom_config.toml"
```

<br>

## 🎨 Themes
Supported themes:
- 🖤 **Dark** – High contrast for low-light environments (default)
- 🤍 **Light** – Bright theme for well-lit spaces
- 🧛 **Dracula** – Vibrant dark theme with colorful highlights
- 🟣 **Indigo** – Calming theme with indigo tones

To change the theme you can press `Tab` within the app or if you want to set a default theme on startup, update the `theme` value in `config.toml` file.

<br>

## App Contexts
TraceView operates in three primary contexts, each with context-specific controls and keybindings:

1. **Explorer Context** 🗂️  – Navigate and browse the filesystem.
2. **Search Context** 🔎 – Input and execute file/directory searches.
3. **Result Context** 📄 – View and export search results.

* Please use the provided help page by pressing “F1” to view all keyboard shortcuts and their context.

## 🧮 Status Bar Features
The status bar, located at the bottom of the interface, provides:
- 🗂️ **Current Context**: Shows whether you are in Explorer, Search, or Result context.
- 🎨 **Active Theme**: Displays the currently applied theme.
- ⌨️ **Last Keystroke**: Shows the last pressed key.
- ❗ **Error Messages**: Displays any application errors or warnings.

<br>

## 🔎 Searching by File or Directory Name
TraceView provides a powerful search feature that allows users to search specifically for **file and directory names**. The search functionality focuses only on names, making it possible to:
- Search for specific filenames.
- Search by partial matches (e.g., typing "log" to find "app_log.txt").
- Search by file extensions (e.g., ".txt" to find all text files).

### 🔍 **Search Options:**
TraceView offers two search modes:
- **Flat Search:** 🔎 Searches only within the currently selected directory (non-recursive). Ideal for quick local searches.
- **Deep Search:** 🌐 Recursively searches through all subdirectories within the selected path. Useful for locating files or directories in nested structures.

### 📝 **Search Input History:**
- The input field for typing search queries maintains a **history of previous searches** during the current session.
- Navigate through past queries using the **Up (↑)** and **Down (↓)** arrow keys to quickly reuse or modify previous searches.
- This feature enhances efficiency, especially when refining searches or repeating common queries.

✅ **Usage Notes:**
- Initiate a search by pressing `Ctrl + F` in the Explorer Context.
- Enter your search query and choose between Flat or Deep mode.
- Search results are displayed instantly based on the selected mode.

⚠️ **Performance Considerations:**
- **Deep Search** in large directory structures may take longer, especially if the `follow_sym_links` configuration option is enabled.
- **Flat Search** provides faster results for localized searches.

## 🗂️ Capturing File and Directory Metadata
TraceView allows users to capture metadata for both files and directories with the following considerations:

### 📄 **File Metadata**
- File metadata is available immediately after invoking the metadata view (press `M` in Explorer Context).
- Displayed information includes file size, permissions, last modified date, and ownership.

### 📁 **Directory Metadata**
- Directory metadata collection may take longer, especially for large directories.
- This is because TraceView recursively scans all contained files and subdirectories to determine:
  - 📏 Total size
  - 🗂️ Number of contained files
  - 📂 Number of contained subdirectories
- **Note:** The depth and complexity of the directory structure will affect the processing time.
- If `follow_sym_links` is enabled in the configuration, symbolic links within directories are also traversed, potentially increasing processing time.
---

<br>

## ⏳ If Things Take a Long Time
Some operations in TraceView, such as searching for files/directories or exporting search results, may take longer to complete depending on the size and complexity of the filesystem. 

✅ **Cancel Ongoing Processes:**  
- You can quit the app at any time by pressing **Ctrl + Q**.  
- This is especially useful during deep searches or large directory exports that require extensive processing time.
---

<br>

## 🚫 Limitations & Future Plans
While TraceView offers a variety of features for browsing, searching, and viewing metadata, it is important to note that **it is not a full-fledged file explorer**. As such:
- 🗑️ **File or directory manipulation (copying, moving, deleting, or renaming) is not supported.**
- 🚀 **These features may be planned for a future release** to enhance the app’s file management capabilities.
- 📄 TraceView is currently designed to provide safe, read-only access to filesystem information without risking unintended file modifications.

## 🧪 Tested Platforms
TraceView has been tested on the following operating systems and environments with **x86_64** CPU architecture:

| Operating System | Version         | Terminal/Shell                                  |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| 🪟 Windows       | 10 (Pro)        | Windows Terminal, PowerShell                    |
| 🐧 Ubuntu Linux  | 24.10           | GNOME-Terminal / bash, zsh                      |
| 🐧 Linux Mint    | 22.1            | GNOME-Terminal / bash, zsh                      |
| 🍎 macOS         | Monterey (12.x) | iTerm2 / zsh                                    |

### Notice
When testing under MacOs, I noticed that the standard terminal does not fully support true RGB (24-bit) colors. For this reason, the test was also carried out with the third-party terminal `iTerm2'`. There all colors are displayed as expected. So if you notice an incorrect display of colors under MacOs, please use the [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) terminal.

<br>

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
### 🪟 **Windows Terminal Freeze Issue**
If you experience the app freezing when clicking inside the terminal window with the **left mouse button** on Windows, this is due to the terminal's default behavior of entering "selection mode." In this mode, terminal input is paused while text is being selected. To avoid this issue:
- Use keyboard navigation instead of mouse clicks.
- Right-click outside the terminal to regain control.
- Change terminal settings to disable selection mode if supported.

### ❗ **Error Messages and Logs**
If an error appears in the status bar:
- A brief error description is displayed in the status bar.
- For detailed information, consult the **log file** located in the app's `data` directory.
  - The log file includes timestamps, error descriptions, and debugging information.
  - Check the logs if you encounter unexpected behavior or crashes.
